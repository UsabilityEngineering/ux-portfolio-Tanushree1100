# UX Portfolio

Hi!My name is Tanushree Trivedi(Shree – if that’s easier) ! Nice to meet you ! I am a senior at Chico State, majoring in Computer Science. I was born in India and moved to United States when I was 17. I am really interest in User Interface Design , Frontend Development or User Experience Design/Engineering . I have always been an artist at my core, and I discovered my passion and interest for coding after signing up for a coding bootcamp before my freshmen year if college. To be able to combine both of my interest and make a career out of that conjunction would be an absolute dream. My hobbies include painting, sketching, solving puzzles, reading. I also love working out and being outdoors as much as I can.
