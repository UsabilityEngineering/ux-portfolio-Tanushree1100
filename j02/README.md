# Music Controls on Headphones
As a user of the [Crusher Evo Sensory Bass Headphones with Personal Sound](https://www.skullcandy.com/crusher-evo-wireless-headphones/), I have had a great listening experience with these headphones, particularly for bass-heavy music. One of the standout features of these headphones is the straightforward and simple button layout, making it **easy to operate for both novice and experienced users.**

The design of the headphones has been focused on **flexibility and efficiency**, with the plastic body of the headphones being lightweight and comfortable for extended use. The buttons are easy to access and use, and there are shortcuts available to improve the interaction for experienced users without sacrificing simplicity for those who are less familiar with the headphones.

On the right side of the headphones, there are volume up, pause, and volume down buttons. The bass slider, which is located on the left side of the headphones, is an interesting and unique feature that sets it apart from other headphones on the market. The slider allows users to adjust the bass output to their personal preference. What's particularly noteworthy about the bass slider is how it resembles a bass booster on a turntable, which **maps well to the real world** and makes it easy for users to understand how the slider works and what effect it will have on their listening experience.

During my usage, I was able to customize my experience by setting up shortcuts, making it even easier to control the headphones. However, I did find one issue with the controls - changing the track by long-pressing the volume up button would trigger the song to jump forward 10 seconds, which was not my intention. This became frustrating, especially during a workout, where I had to change the track from my phone manually.

To address this issue, I believe that implementing a different gesture, such as a double-click or tap on the volume-up button, would make the interaction more seamless and natural. These gestures are familiar to me from other contexts, such as double-clicking to open a file or tapping to select an item, and would be easier to remember and use without interrupting my listening experience. This solution would align with my **mental model** of how the controls should work and reduce **cognitive load** by making the interaction more seamless and natural.

In summary, the Crusher Evo Sensory Bass Headphones with Personal Sound offer high-quality sound and customizable preferences, with a lightweight and comfortable design suitable for extended use. The controls are clear and straightforward, and with the suggested modification, the user experience could be even better. Overall, I highly recommend these headphones for anyone looking for a great listening experience, especially for bass-heavy music.
