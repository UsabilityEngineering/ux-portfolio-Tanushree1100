# Music Controls on Headphones

I use [Crusher Evo Sensory Bass Headphones with Personal Sound](https://www.skullcandy.com/crusher-evo-wireless-headphones/) for listening to bass-heavy music. A common feature of every Bluetooth-enabled headphone is to be able to wirelessly connect to multiple devices and easily switch between them. Most wireless headphones have a standard sound output but what makes these headphones stand out because that headphone is compatible with an app called “Skullcandy” which lets the user adjust their headphone bass output preferences.

Skullcandy Headphones are very simple-to-use headphones and display **“ Flexibility and efficiency of use”**, which is an essential part of usability outlines as the buttons on the headphones are relatively** intuitive**. Still, the Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. The bass slider located on the left resembles a bass booster on a turntable and maps fairly well to the real world. 

Generally, ear headphones tend to be heavier on the ears and can cause ears to feel heavy after wearing them for a prolonged period of time. But due to the use of plastic as the main material for its body, these headphones provide all-day comfort but this leads to the headphones looking a bit on the cheaper side even though the performance of the headphones is probably regarded as one of the best in markets.


The headphones have 3 main control buttons on the right which are volume up, pause, and volume down. Using them the first time it was fairly easy to figure out the volume change and my **mental model** matched the **conceptual model**of how the control system worked. After walking through the user manual, I set up my own shortcuts, which allowed me to long press the volume up button to change the track. 

Changing the track required me to press down the button for more than one second which was very inconvenient as pressing the button down for more than one second triggered the song to jump forward 10 seconds and which was not the intention. I was not able to **recover from the error** and had to manually change the track from my phone instead of the headphone controls which was very frustrating as I generally use these headphones while working out which meant I had to stop and reach out to my phone. In my opinion, a good solution would be to change the gesture to either double-click or tap to differentiate between fast-forward and change of track.
